When getting the following error when running the app on an iOS simulator/device:

"System.Net.WebException: The resource could not be loaded because the App Transport Security policy requires the use of a secure connection."

Do the following steps:

1. Open the Project target's info.plist file

2. Add a Key called NSAppTransportSecurity as a Dictionary.

3. Add a Subkey called NSAllowsArbitraryLoads as Boolean and set its value to YES.

Clean the Project and Now Everything should be Running fine.

EDIT: OR In source code of info.plist file we can add that:

<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
        <true/>
        <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
        <dict>
            <key>yourdomain.com</key>
            <dict>
                <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key>
                <true/>
                <key>NSThirdPartyExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>
                <false/>
            </dict>
       </dict>
  </dict>
