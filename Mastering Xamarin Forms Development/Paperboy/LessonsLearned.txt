When converting a Xamarin Forms App to a Prism Xamarin Forms App you should do the following:

1. Open App.xaml.cs in the main/common project

2. Change
  
  public partial class App : Application {

  to

  public partial class App {

3. Add the following comment (optional) for clarity:

    /* 
     * The Xamarin Forms XAML Previewer in Visual Studio uses System.Activator.CreateInstance.
     * This imposes a limitation in which the App class must have a default constructor. 
     * App(IPlatformInitializer initializer = null) cannot be handled by the Activator.
     */

4. Comment out or remove the existing Constructor and add the following constructors:

    public App() : this(null) { }

    public App(IPlatformInitializer initializer) : base(initializer) { }

5. Add 

	using Prism;
	using Prism.Ioc;

6. Add the following method:

    protected override async void OnInitialized() {
      InitializeComponent();

      await NavigationService.NavigateAsync("NavigationPage/MainPage");
    }

	where the last line is added if you will use the NavigationPage concept. If not you just refer to the 
	starting page instead, i.e.:

	      await NavigationService.NavigateAsync("MainPage");

7. Add the following method:

    protected override void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry) {
      containerRegistry.RegisterForNavigation<NavigationPage>();
      containerRegistry.RegisterForNavigation<MainPage, MainPageViewModel>();
    }

   If the NavigationPage concept is not to be used, then just add:

    containerRegistry.RegisterForNavigation<MainPage, MainPageViewModel>();

8. Add every other page you should be able to navigate to in the RegisterTypes method

9. Create the folders Views and ViewModels

10. Add all your views to the Views folder and all your viewmodels to the ViewModels folder

11. Open the file MainActivity.cs in the Android project

12. Comment out or remove the line

      LoadApplication(new App());

	and add the following

      LoadApplication(new App(new AndroidInitializer()));

13. Add the following class in the same file as MainActivity.cs but below (outside) the MainActivity class and in the same namespace

  public class AndroidInitializer : IPlatformInitializer {
    public void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry) {
      // Register any platform specific implementations
    }
  }

14. Add the following usings

	using Prism;
	using Prism.Ioc;

15. Open the file AppDelegate in the iOS project

16. Comment out or remove the line

      LoadApplication(new App());

	and add the following

      LoadApplication(new App(new iOSInitializer()));

17. Add the following class in the same file as AppDelegate.cs but below (outside) the AppDelegate class and in the same namespace

  public class iOSInitializer : IPlatformInitializer {
    public void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry) {
      // Register any platform specific implementations
    }
  }

18. Add the following usings

	using Prism;
	using Prism.Ioc;

19. Open the file MainPage.xaml.cs in the UWP project

20. Comment out or remove the line

      LoadApplication(new App());

	and add the following

      LoadApplication(new App(new UwpInitializer()));

21. Add the following class in the same file as MainPage.xml.cs but below (outside) the MainPage class and in the same namespace

  public class UwpInitializer : IPlatformInitializer {
    public void RegisterTypes(IContainerRegistry containerRegistry) {
      // Register any platform specific implementations
    }
  }

22. Add the following usings

	using Prism;
	using Prism.Ioc;

23. Open the other partial App class, i.e. right click on the App class in App.xaml.cs in the common project and choose Go To Definition.
	You will then get all the partial classes in the bottom in VS. You should open the auto-generated one which should look something like

	public partial class App : global::Xamarin.Forms.Application {

	and with a filename like App.xaml.g.cs

24. Change the following row

    public partial class App : global::Xamarin.Forms.Application {

	to

    public partial class App : global::Prism.Unity.PrismApplication {

25. Compile and run.
